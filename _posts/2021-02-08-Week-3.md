HARKing is "Hypothesizing After the Results are Known".

I sometimes talk about this as the 'no peeking rule' in setting up hypotheses. For example, you should never pick a one-tailed hypothesis test because of your data, it should only be based on findings from previous studies or a physical theory of a phenomenon.

There was a good introduction to this idea in last week's Motulsky paper (the XKCD jelly bean comic!). Kerr, N. L. (1998). "HARKing: Hypothesizing after the results are known". Personality and Social Psychology Review. 2 (3): 196–217. doi:10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4

There are critiques about whether HARKing is as harmful to science as sometimes claimed and a lot of yummy philosophy of science that we won't go into. If you're interested in this area, try reading Rubin (2017), "When Does HARKing Hurt? Identifying When Different Types of Undisclosed Post Hoc Hypothesizing Harm Scientific Progress"
