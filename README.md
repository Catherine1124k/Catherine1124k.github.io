## PROJECT EXPERIENCE
**2020 US Election Prediction Project		                                           Oct 2020**
- Bulleted	Modeling the data and predict the result by post-stratification in order to estimate the proportion of voters who will vote for Donald Trump
- Bulleted	Concluding the specific logistic regression model by using _data.svyglm_ and got the relationship between the age group, gender, income, race, and state and the probability that vote for Donald Trump.
- Bulleted	Separating the swing state and the unswing state using _Predict()_ to see the different result between these two situations, and got that the Donald Trump would win without the swing state

**Marketing Campaign Response Rate Pridiction with SAS Project               May 2019 – June 2019**
- Bulleted	Utilized the Stepwise method to select variables and built a Logistic Regression model in SAS so as to predict the response rate for a marketing campaign and achieve a model accuracy of 85%
- Bulleted	Conducted exploratory method data analysis, converted categorical variables into numerical values through encoding, and imputed missing values for a model build
- Bulleted	Utilized Pandas in SAS to process above 45k raw data, impute missing values, and clean data for model building 
- Bulleted	Splited the imputed data set into training and tested the dataset which is 70% of data for the training to process over 45k raw data by using _PROC SURVEYSELECT_
- Bulleted	Create the missing imputation to process over 45k raw data and impute missing value to a new dataset by using _PROC STDIZE_

**Modeling and analyzing the bond yield curves by mathematical financial method                Feb 2021**
- Bulleted	Summarized the historical date of 32 bonds including their closed prices, maturity, and issue date, etc. Selected 10 of them by their characteristics and using python to construct the curves.
- Bulleted	By generated classes in python to construct the function for the yield-to-maturity curve and plot the line graphs of these 10 bonds’ yield curve. Similar methods to generate the spot curve and the 1-year forward curve, and plot them.
- Bulleted	Write the pseudo-code for how I would derive the spot curve with terms ranging from 1-5 years from my chosen bonds, and a pseudo-code for how I would derive the 1-year forward curve with terms ranging from 2-5 years from my chosen bonds. 
- Bulleted	Constructed two covariance matrices for the time series of daily log-returns of yield, and forward rates. Also generate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of both covariance matrices.

**Data analyst			 						    July 2020 – August 2020**
- Bulleted	Designed, implemented, and maintained a SQL database, which met the public security system’s data management and accuracy requirement
- Bulleted	Assisted companies in designing their computer software products to help the police system, banks, courts and other bodies analyze complex data and provide their own opinion
- Bulleted	In an underground bank case, wrote complex SQL queries and used in-house software which is called penetrating insight to help analyze the flow data of the month, build a network and filter data to find the final suspect
